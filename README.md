A scratchpad repo for OpenAI Codex

[OpenAI Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) needs a GitHub repository to create an environment.

Codex is useful for all sorts of things other than just working on that repo, especially if you [enable internet access](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/3/codex-agent-internet-access/). See [Vibe scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/17/vibe-scraping/) for example.

This repo enables me to run those kinds of projects.
